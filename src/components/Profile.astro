  <h2>Professional Profile</h2>
  <p>
    I am a highly capable Software Engineer and enthusiastic individual with a keen interest in technology and software
    development. I specialise primarily in Frontend technologies now, but I have in the past worked in what is termed
    Full-Stack roles. I have a strong background in web development and have worked on a number of projects, both
    personal and professional. I am a quick learner and have a strong work ethic. I am always looking to improve my
    skills and learn new technologies.

    I am a team player and like working in a collaborative atmosphere. I also have experience mentoring, leading and
    managing people.

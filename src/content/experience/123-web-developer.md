My role in 123.ie was mainly focused in the area of Front-end Web
Development. I worked alongside the Java team, assisting them in
delivering 123.ie's business application from a front-end/UI perspective
using **AngularJS**. We were in the process of delivering completely
responsive solutions across our main business applications. During my
time there we delivered responsive Household insurance and Car
insurance applications. I also worked alongside our Marketing team to
support our client facing website, built in **Drupal**. We launched a
Responsive version of our Marketing Site with almost 95% coverage
across all pages.

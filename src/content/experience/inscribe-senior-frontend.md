Hired as a Frontend Engineer, my main toolset in _Inscribe_
consisted of several repositories built using **VueJS**. When I joined, I
worked in conjunction with the Lead Product Designer to build out a **Vue**
Component Library (called _Signal_) using **Rollup** and **Storybook** which
would form the basis of the overhaul of the _Inscribe_ application with the
aim of replacing and upgrading the existing **Bootstrap** styled application.
Our organisation then split into Product Teams, and initially I spent a
number of months on the Collect Team, overhauling a front-facing
application used to gather documents, which enables applicants to upload
them via Collect into the main _Inscribe_ application for processing. More
recently I have been a part of the Credit Insights Product Team,
expanding the feature offering within this product.

- Built out the _Signal_ Component Library and overhauled majority of the _Inscribe_ application suite to use these components using **VueJS**

  Framework**, along with Unit/Integration Testing

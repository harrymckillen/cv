Part of the Software Architecture team, responsible for ensuring our
development teams follow best practices, in terms of good API design,
coding standards etc. From a UI Architecture perspective, I helped form a
new Product Team responsible for the migration of our Front-end Apps
from **AngularJS** to **Angular** (current version at the time was v12). My
involvement covered a number of key areas; assisting with the business
case process, solution design, architectural design of the project, in terms
of tooling and structure of repositories. Have also handled the creation of
our new CI pipelines in **Jenkins**, using **Artifactory** as our own Private NPM
for the storage of build artefacts. We use **SonarQube** as part of our build
process for static code analysis. This has allowed me to establish the
baseline standards which will be rolled out across all product teams with
UI developers in the future. I have been involved in the recruitment,
onboarding and mentoring of new people to the team.

#### Highlights

- Completed **AWS Cloud Practitioner** Course
- Built up good knowledge of **Jenkins**, **JobDSL** and Pipeline Scripting as
  well as tools such as **SonarQube**
- Introduced **Storybook** and **Cypress** to our workflow, each of our
  components are delivered as individual NPM packages, and from several
  repos, namely components, pages, and the overall app. We used **NX** for
  each of the repos, and **LernaJS** to handle the automatic semantic
  versioning of these NPM packages.

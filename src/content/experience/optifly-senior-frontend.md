_Optifly_ delivers flight schedule optimization through a data-driven AI model to large airline clients. As a Senior Frontend Engineer, I work on the client facing UI, which enables _Optifly_'s users to harness the capabilities of their key product, Optimiser. I've been primarily involved in development of enhancements to the most trafficed screens and ensuring that the data heavy application is polished and responsive. I've also helped to improve software delivery through the implementation of development practices gathered from my years of previous experience. The technology stack is an **Angular 18** frontend with a **Java** API backend.

#### Highlights

- Working on a new redesign of the core Schedule Planning feature of the
  main Optifly product, which enhances the current UX

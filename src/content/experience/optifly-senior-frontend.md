Optifly operate in the Aviation sector. Their core product enables LCC airlines
to improve their aircraft utilisation by leveraging the power of their
Optimiser product. The output of which is an airline schedule that is
efficient and improves the airlines KPIs, which translates to profit. As a
Frontend Engineer, I work alongside my colleagues to deliver the main
Frontend product, which enables our core users to harness the
capabilities of Optimiser. It is a very data heavy product. Since joining I
have been involved in the introduction of some new development
practices, improving our existing product, while building out new
features, such as the enhancement of one of the key screens of the
application, the Schedule Plan. The technology stack is an **Angular 18**
Frontend and Java API Backend.

My role in _Xero_ was as a Senior Front End Web Developer for the
Marketing/Design Team. As part of my role I was responsible for
maintaining the existing _Xero_ website & company blog. The main
marketing website was originally a bespoke CMS application built in **C#** &
**XSLT**. In the last number of months I worked on helping to re-develop the
marketing site into a CMS, using the Open Source .NET solution,
Umbraco. The core languages I used for this role are **HTML/HTML5**,
**Javascript**, **CSS/3**, **XSLT**, **XML**, **C#** & **PHP**.
